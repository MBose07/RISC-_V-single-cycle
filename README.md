# RISC-_V-single-cycle
# Single-Cycle 32-bit RISC-V Processor

A fully compliant single-cycle 32-bit RISC-V (RV32I) processor implemented in Verilog.  
All instructions are implemented strictly according to the RISC-V specification and have been individually tested using directed testbenches.

**Features**
- RV32I base integer instruction set
- Single-cycle datapath
- Synthesizable RTL design
- Verified arithmetic, memory, and control-flow instructions

**Status**
✔ All implemented instructions tested and verified
